TINIBA
===========================
TINIBA is a tool written in bash, perl, and fortran to do ab initio calculations of optical responses based on the popular ABINIT.

This project was built by the PRONASIS group of the Centro de Investigaciones en Ã“ptica, A.C. in Mexico. It has been a collaborative project spanning almost a decade. TINIBA has been used in (at least) the following articles:

This is my rewrite of the official 2.0 release and will continue to be improved upon as time allows. New features and fixes are added into the 'work' branch and are then tested in the 'testing' branch. Full documentation for the project is located in the tiniba-manual repository. It is a work in progress but will allow the average user to get up and running without too many problems.

I suggest adding these lines to the appropriate shell file:

```bash
export TINIBA=$HOME/tiniba
export PATH="$TINIBA/clustering:$TINIBA/utils:$PATH"
```
