TINIBA
===========================
TINIBA is a tool written in bash, perl, and fortran to do ab initio calculations of optical responses based on the popular ABINIT.

Introduction
-------------------

This is the official 3.0 release. New features and fixes are added all the time via different branches, and then merged into the master branch. Full documentation for the project is located in the tiniba-manual repository. It is a work in progress but will allow the average user to get up and running without too many problems.

I suggest adding these lines to the appropriate shell file:

```bash
export TINIBA=$HOME/tiniba/ver3.0
export PATH="$TINIBA/clustering/itaxeo:$TINIBA/utils:$PATH"
```

For more information you can contact me at sma@cio.mx and I will be happy to answer any questions.

To-do List and WIP
-------------------

1. Correcting SHG via shg-notes (07/13/14)

    The work branch of TINIBA contains some preliminary work with calpmn. The next stage is working on integrands.f90. First, take a look at Eq. I15 and compare to Eq. G2 that is already coded. These two can be placed in the same subroutine and may be readily completed.

    What needs to be done: code Eqs. I15, and I17 and verify that I17 yields the same result as G2.

2. `latm/SRC_1setinput`

* `integrands.f90`:
    - [ ] add new case => new number and new subroutine

* `inparams.f90`:
    - [ ] add new case at the top of the program 
    - [ ] change: number_of_known_spectrum_types
    - [ ] add spectrum_factor() at the end of it
    - [ ] add new case so one knows what's calculated

* `symmetry_operations.f90`:
    - [ ] add new case at the top of the program
    - [ ] add new case for the correct transformation
